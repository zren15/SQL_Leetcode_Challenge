+--------------+---------+
invoice_id is the primary key for this table.

Write an SQL query to find the following for each invoice_id:

customer_name: The name of the customer the invoice is related to.
price: The price of the invoice.
contacts_cnt: The number of contacts related to the customer.
trusted_contacts_cnt: The number of contacts related to the customer and at the same time they are customers to the shop. (i.e their email exists in the Customers table.)
Return the result table ordered by invoice_id.

The query result format is in the following example.
