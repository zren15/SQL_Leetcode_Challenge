id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.
 

Write an SQL query to find all dates Id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Weather table:
+----+------------+-------------+
| id | recordDate | temperature |
+----+------------+-------------+
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
+----+------------+-------------+
Output: 
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 2  |
| 4  |
+----+
Explanation: 
In 2015-01-02, the temperature was higher than the previous day (10 -> 25).
In 2015-01-04, the temperature was higher than the previous day (20 -> 30).


# Write your MySQL query statement below
# 自己写的，存在特定bug
select id from 
(select id, temperature,
       Lag(temperature,1)OVER(order by id) as num_1   #选择指定行的向后一行的内容
from weather
    ) A
where A.temperature > A.num_1


# 好的solution
SELECT
    weather.id AS Id
FROM
    weather
        JOIN
    weather w ON DATEDIFF(weather.recordDate, w.recordDate) = 1
        AND weather.Temperature > w.Temperature
;
