# 自己写的不是optimal
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select employee_name as Employee
from Employee
inner join (select managerId, salary as employee_salary,name as employee_name from Employee) Employee1 on Employee.id = Employee1.managerId
where employee_salary > salary

# better answer 1
SELECT
    a.Name AS 'Employee'
FROM
    Employee AS a,
    Employee AS b
WHERE
    a.ManagerId = b.Id
        AND a.Salary > b.Salary
;

# better answer 2
SELECT
     a.NAME AS Employee
FROM Employee AS a JOIN Employee AS b
     ON a.ManagerId = b.Id
     AND a.Salary > b.Salary
;
